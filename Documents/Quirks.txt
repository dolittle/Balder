IView:
- Position - A generic view should not have this

IObjectFactory:
- Not needed, use the IKernel directly - if absolutely needed

Node + other objects dependencies in Silverlight:
- Can have their dependencies injected by the Game in which they belong to

Viewport:
- Viewport should hold the Scene and render the scene in its own viewport

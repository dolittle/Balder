Structs:
	Use ref for method arguments instead - a lot faster - by value invokes a construction of a new version and copies it all into the new one
	
Drawing primitives:
	Use span rendering - sorted front to back, automatically clip with already drawn spans and skip any pixels
	that is not needed to draw
